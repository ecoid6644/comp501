        <h3>
          What can we do?
        </h3>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>One thing that we can do to keep the user safe physically is through extensive research and testing of the Technology. Although we can never be completely sure of anything, we can at least put in the effort to make sure there is minimal chance for anything bad to happen. By having extensive testing, we can make sure the physical safety of the user is kept. However, the act of extensively researching and testing comes with the dilemma with the privacy of user data. To have extensive research, we must collect large amounts of usage data.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>
          So, what can we do to protect the user's privacy?
        </h3>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>One option as a developer/researcher is to sit down with the user and talk through the terms and conditions of usage. With such long terms and conditions, we often simply click okay without reading through. This sometimes causes unnecessary problems regarding data privacy. By simply talking through with the user, and as a user, listening to the terms and conditions, the number of problems regarding data privacy can decrease drastically.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Another way that we can protect the user’s privacy is through using more secure technology. Chaudhary, P and Agrawal, R suggests that “Privacy and security should be considered with legal and defined standards and protocols to mitigate the threats associated with BCI design. More secure transceivers and use of an anonymizer either in hardware or software form can protect user’s privacy with a great intent.” There is currently a patent by Chizeck and Bonaci “BCI Anonymizer” which is used by many researchers to enhance neural privacy and security. The basic idea of this is to remove all the unintended information embedded into the raw data except specific intended command information.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>
          Finally, we need to develop and set laws for data privacy concerning BCI.
        </h3>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>This would make the most difference but will be the hardest to implement. The aforementioned Universal Declaration of Human Rights was first declared in 1948 and according to "Evolution of Brain-Computer Interfaces" written by Fabien Lotte, Chang S. Nam, and Anton Nijholt, BCI was first introduced in 1973. So, it is clear as to why there are no definite laws regarding BCI and data privacy. BCI was introduced after the law was set in place. So, it is about time to update these laws to match our society today. Alžběta Krausová suggests that “Risk management measures must be put in effect to prevent the misuse of this technology. We must carefully examine the technology and set out a legal framework that would use brain=computer interfaces in such a manner that this will lead to broadening freedoms and rights of humans rather than limiting them. “ </p>
