        <h3>
          What Risks come with BCI?
        </h3>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>When using a Brain Computer Interface, the user and developer must always face the potential risks that this modern technology brings. This may be regulation, law, and accessibility. But most importantly, we must consider user safety and within that, data privacy.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>
          Physical User Safety regarding BCI
        </h3>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>According to "Privacy and security issues in BCI" written by K. Sudararajan (2017), there is a type of attack on BCI called a Data modification attack. In this type of attack, the offender intercepts between the BCI device and the computer, then changes what is sent to the computer to alter what happens. According to P. Chaudary and R. Agrawal, "An attacker can easily exploit the measuring devices to alter, block, or snoop in neural signals. The attacker can intercept the data and can use it to take decisions on behalf of the user of BCI system. For example, in prosthetic limbs, an attacker can illicit commands and can give wrong movement to the limb."  </p>
        <br>
        <p>In a scenario in which a BCI device is used as an authentication device, an attacker can make a model based on synthetic brain waves or on historical data which can be used to forge the authentication of a user. A brain spyware introduced by Martinovic is an example which demonstrates that using a BCI game, an attacker can extract information like PIN number, date of birth, location, etc.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>
          User Safety regarding BCI and Data Privacy
        </h3>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>According to "Emerging threats to security and privacy in brain computer interface" written by Chaudhary, P. and Agrawal, R. (2019), An experiment upon a BCI device under the name Emotic EPOC headset, was conducted. By recording the EEG signals, more specifically the P300 signal, they concluded that personal information could be extracted via a BCI device.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Regarding data privacy within BCI, Alžběta Krausová states that there are laws that correlate to this topic. These are the Universal Declaration of Human Rights where it includes the Right to Privacy (Article 12 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights), Freedom of Thought (Article 18 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights) and Freedom of Expression (Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights).</p>
        <br>
        <p>According to Article 12 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, “One shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy, family, home, or correspondence, nor to attacks upon his honor and reputation. Everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks.” Alžběta Krausová says “Unfortunately, in order to function, the BCIs (Brain Computer Interfaces) necessarily have to monitor neural activity of their users and, therefore, collect and process intrinsically private and sensitive information relating to their users.”  The law would need to find a way to guard this right since guaranteeing such right has even biological justification for people to function normally and without fear of being exposed, and, therefore, highly vulnerable.</p>
        <br>
        <p>In BCI, the right of freedom of thought and right to privacy are interconnected. In the past, thoughts were considered private but with BCIs, this may be different. Alžběta Krausová says that “Theoretically, given the possible threat of being monitored in their mind, people would be forced to change their ‘inner life’. When being afraid of others, individuals may limit the scope of their thoughts which would lead to serious impacts on their cognitive capabilities, intelligence, and fantasies.”</p>
        <br>
        <p>Although these laws exist, none of them directly correspond to BCI and how the data collected will be used. In fact, there are currently no set laws specifically for this technology. Thus, risk management measures must be put in effect to prevent the misuse of this technology. We must carefully examine the technology and set out a legal framework that would use brain=computer interfaces in such a manner that this will lead to broadening freedoms and rights of humans rather than limiting them.</p>
