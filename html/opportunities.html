          BCIs can benefit and improve people’s lives in many ways
        </h3>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>A key future opportunity of BCIs is its ability to help disabled people interact with computer systems and technology. According to Neuralink(2022), one of the ways they would be able to help would be allowing people who either struggle or cannot interact with the current methods of interaction to be able to interact. Many people struggle, due to their disabilities, with the motor interaction required to use a mouse and keyboard, resulting in them either struggling or just not being able to use a computer. </p>
        <br>
        <p>According to KEDRI, another way they would be able to help disabled people would be in controlling technology used to help overcome/mitigate the problems that their disability causes them. With brain computer interfaces people would be able to seamlessly control prosthetic limbs, help paralysed people regain control of their body. </p>
        <br>
        <p>Another key opportunity of BCIs is its ability to vastly increase the speed / efficiency in which we interact with computers. If you have ever typed anything on a computer before you would know that you cannot type anywhere near as fast as your brain thinks. With the BCIs you would be able to directly project your thought into text. This would vastly decrease the amount of time you are spending typing things in your search bar, writing documents, or just anything you do on your computer.</p>
