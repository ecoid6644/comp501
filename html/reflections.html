        <p>The technology that our group decided to research was Brain Computer Interface (BCI). The aim of this technology is to connect the user and a device so that the user can directly manipulate the device through thinking, or more specifically brain waves and brain signals.  However, while researching this technology, I realized a series of problems regarding ethical implications of this technology. The most relevant issues that I found were privacy and user safety. By finding out these potential risks or ethical issues, my way of thinking towards BCI has changed quite a bit. </p>
        <br>
        <p>At the beginning, before researching the ethical implications of this technology, my view towards this technology was mostly on the positive side. “The future of Human Computer Interaction” would be the phrase that would fit my view at this point. But at this point in time, BCI has a little too much risks that I would entrust my future of computer interaction. Since there is no set law currently regarding this technology, we can sort of say that this technology runs purely off human ethics. But other than that, the technology runs under anarchy. Because of this, the only way that we can be sure that we are safe with the technology is to set out proper contracts, terms and conditions of usage, and rules between the user and the developer. As a single potential user, I realized that there isn’t much that I can do to protect myself while using this technology. The one thing that may be effective that I could do is to read the Terms and Conditions properly instead of skimming or out right skipping that I often do. </p>
        <br>
        <p>But the fact that this technology is running under anarchy might just be good for the advancement of this technology. Because there isn’t any set rule for dealing with this technology, the developers and researchers can have the freedom to research and develop as far as their idea of ethics allow them. This sort of conflicts what I said earlier but with the freedom of research, as long as proper user safety is considered and privacy of the user is kept safe, I think that this freedom can bring better than bad. But again, when this technology eventually comes out to the mass public, this technology must have a specific law so that if people do skip terms and conditions, nothing too bad can happen. As I said before, at the beginning of the research, I had the idea that this technology is “The future of Human Computer Interaction”. I still believe that this technology will eventually replace our mouse and keyboard. </p>
        <br>
        <p>To simply summarize my thoughts, at the beginning, I was all in for this technology. But at the end of the research, the fact that user safety and privacy lies on the hands of the ethics of the researchers and developers, I simply do not want to use this technology until proper law and regulation are put in so that the user safety and privacy of myself is assured. </p>
