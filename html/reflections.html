        <p>At the start of our research, I knew very little about brain computer interfaces (BCI) and what sort of impact it could have on society. Researching BCI has shown to me what sort of future we could have when it comes to human computer interactions. In essence, BCI allows users to interact with computers just by simply using their brains. This means the user isn’t physically interacting with anything, rather their brain signals are read by a device which then translates this into commands for a computer to use. Although, while there is so much potential for good with BCI it raises questions on how ethical it is and how data privacy and user safety is concerned. </p>
        <br>
        <p>From what I’ve learned during this research it is highly likely that in the near future BCI is going to assist in rehabilitation of those with disabilities. This is another step forward in allowing those with disabilities the same opportunities as everyone else. While BCI does have the ability to help people, it can also be subject to malice. Just like much of the technology we have now was intended to be used for good, there are still times where it will be taken advantage of for malicious reasons. To best protect the use of BCI it is important to understand the risks associated with it and find ways to ensure these risks are managed.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Overall, I believe the development of BCI is crucial to the future of human computer interaction. Although, during this development it is essential that rules and regulations are set in place to protect BCI as well as protecting the users of BCI. Without any regulation around all the current concerns with BCI will continue to develop and worsen over time. Regulations would help make BCI more open and transparent with users which in turn would clear up any ethical problems that there may have been.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Finally, looking back on all I have learnt throughout this research I still look at BCI in a positive light as there is so much potential with this technology. However, it is vital regulations and rules are set before BCI becomes a more mainstream and useable technology. Otherwise, general people will not want to use a technology they know is not fully regulated as it put them at risk.</p>

        <br>
        <p>In the future I believe the ubiquitous use of BCIs will be inevitable. This is why it is so important to start thinking about their future uses and implications before they start mainstream testing. Currently the uses of them are very limited. However, in the future, I believe they will be the main way we interact with computers / machines. Although, with this comes many potential risks BCIs encompass. Personally, I believe that the benefits that BCIs can bring clearly outweigh the potential risks. The main issue of concern people have with BCIs is with what data they can collect from your brain. </p>
        <br>
        <p>Before starting this group project I knew about most of the benefits of BCIs. However, I had never really looked or thought about the ethical cons / risks they entailed. My opinion on them then was that they were clearly worth it when comparing the pros and cons. However, again I had never really looked into the ethical cons / risks. I often find that people don’t look into or they choose to ignore the risks of new technology they read about. This is a problem as all technology has potential risks, and with less people knowing about them they are more likely to go from potential to real risks. </p>
        <br>
        <p>After further looking into BCIs during this project my opinion has pretty much stayed the same. However, this is assuming that in the near future countries and companies start looking into ways to minimise the risks that BCIs encompass. With this I mind I believe it to be essential to create international laws informing companies / individuals on what data can be legally used or collected from their user’s brain waves. I also believe it should be mandatory practice for companies / individuals to clearly outline to their users what data they are collecting from them. Accompanying this, I also think that companies should provide, when asked by the user, the data they have collected of them and how it has been used, allowing users to clearly what and how their data has been used. Without these or other similar ideas, I believe the potential risks would be too great for the average person to see BCIs as worth it. </p>

        <p>The technology that our group decided to research was Brain Computer Interface (BCI). The aim of this technology is to connect the user and a device so that the user can directly manipulate the device through thinking, or more specifically brain waves and brain signals.  However, while researching this technology, I realized a series of problems regarding ethical implications of this technology. The most relevant issues that I found were privacy and user safety. By finding out these potential risks or ethical issues, my way of thinking towards BCI has changed quite a bit. </p>
        <br>
        <p>At the beginning, before researching the ethical implications of this technology, my view towards this technology was mostly on the positive side. “The future of Human Computer Interaction” would be the phrase that would fit my view at this point. But at this point in time, BCI has a little too much risks that I would entrust my future of computer interaction. Since there is no set law currently regarding this technology, we can sort of say that this technology runs purely off human ethics. But other than that, the technology runs under anarchy. Because of this, the only way that we can be sure that we are safe with the technology is to set out proper contracts, terms and conditions of usage, and rules between the user and the developer. As a single potential user, I realized that there isn’t much that I can do to protect myself while using this technology. The one thing that may be effective that I could do is to read the Terms and Conditions properly instead of skimming or out right skipping that I often do. </p>
        <br>
        <p>But the fact that this technology is running under anarchy might just be good for the advancement of this technology. Because there isn’t any set rule for dealing with this technology, the developers and researchers can have the freedom to research and develop as far as their idea of ethics allow them. This sort of conflicts what I said earlier but with the freedom of research, as long as proper user safety is considered and privacy of the user is kept safe, I think that this freedom can bring better than bad. But again, when this technology eventually comes out to the mass public, this technology must have a specific law so that if people do skip terms and conditions, nothing too bad can happen. As I said before, at the beginning of the research, I had the idea that this technology is “The future of Human Computer Interaction”. I still believe that this technology will eventually replace our mouse and keyboard. </p>
        <br>
        <p>To simply summarize my thoughts, at the beginning, I was all in for this technology. But at the end of the research, the fact that user safety and privacy lies on the hands of the ethics of the researchers and developers, I simply do not want to use this technology until proper law and regulation are put in so that the user safety and privacy of myself is assured. </p>
